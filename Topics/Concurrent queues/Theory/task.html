<p>One of the most popular kinds of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4987" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a concurrent collection is a type of collection that is designed to be used in concurrent programming, where multiple threads need to access and modify the collection simultaneously. | They are thread-safe, meaning that they are designed to handle concurrent access by multiple threads without compromising on data consistency. Unlike classic collections, which can become a bottleneck in a multithreaded environment, concurrent collections are optimized for concurrent access and provide high-performance even when multiple threads are accessing and modifying the collection simultaneously. One popular type of concurrent collection is a concurrent queue, which is often used to organize communication between multiple threads within an application by exchanging data. Concurrent collections use various techniques such as lock-striping, fine-grained locking, and lock-free algorithms to achieve thread-safety and high-performance.">concurrent collections</a> is a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4987" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a concurrent queue is a type of thread-safe collection that follows the first-in-first-out (FIFO) principle. | It is often used for communication between multiple threads within an application by exchanging data such as messages, tasks, or units of work. A concurrent queue, such as ConcurrentLinkedQueue, allows multiple threads to add and remove elements without the need for external synchronization. This is because the queue's add and remove methods are atomic, meaning they cannot be interrupted by other threads. This ensures that no elements are lost or duplicated during concurrent access.">concurrent queue</a></strong>. Concurrent queues are often used to organize communication between multiple threads within an application by exchanging data (messages, tasks, units of work, or something else). To achieve this communication, several threads should have a reference to a common queue and invoke its methods.</p>
<p>You already know that a queue is a collection that works according to the <strong>first-in-first-out principle</strong> (FIFO): the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.</p>
<h5 id="thread-safety-of-a-concurrentlinkedqueue">Thread-safety of a ConcurrentLinkedQueue</h5>
<p>The simplest type of concurrent queue is a <code class="language-java">ConcurrentLinkedQueue</code>. A <code class="language-java">ConcurrentLinkedQueue</code> is very similar to a standard queue but is <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4987" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, thread-safety refers to the ability of a program to function correctly when accessed by multiple threads concurrently. | When shared data is accessed by multiple threads, there can be issues related to visibility and atomicity. To address these issues, Java provides the concept of a monitor, which is a special mechanism that controls concurrent access to an object. Each object in Java has an associated implicit monitor, and a thread can acquire a monitor, preventing other threads from acquiring it until the owner releases it. When it comes to collections, classic collections like ArrayList, HashMap, and HashSet are not thread-safe, which means that they do not provide thread-safety guarantees. As a result, when multiple threads access and modify these collections concurrently, it can lead to problems such as data inconsistency or runtime exceptions. To address this, Java provides synchronized collections like Vector, Hashtable, and Collections.synchronizedList, which are thread-safe but have lower performance.">thread-safe</a></strong>. It has two methods called <code class="language-java">add</code> and <code class="language-java">offer</code> to add an element to the tail of a queue.</p>
<p>The following example demonstrates the thread safety of this concurrent queue. The program adds new elements to this queue using two threads and then prints the total number of elements:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue;

public class ConcurrentQueueDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // assign a thread-safe implementation
        Queue&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;&gt;();

        Thread writer = new Thread(() -&gt; addNumbers(numbers));
        writer.start();

        addNumbers(numbers); // add numbers from the main thread

        writer.join(); // wait for the writer thread

        System.out.println(numbers.size()); // prints 200_000
    }

    private static void addNumbers(Queue&lt;Integer&gt; target) {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 100_000; i++) {
            target.add(i);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>It is not surprising that this program always prints 200000. As expected, no element is lost. You may start this program as many times as you need. So, <code class="language-java">ConcurrentLinkedQueue</code> is thread-safe. There is also no <code class="language-java">ConcurrentModificationException</code> if we want to iterate over the elements of this queue.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
<p>Note that any single operation provided by this queue is thread-safe. However, if we group such operations in a single method or a sequence of statements, the group of operations will not be thread-safe.</p>
<p>Moreover, bulk operations of <code class="language-java">ConcurrentLinkedQueue</code> that add, remove, or examine multiple elements, such as <code class="language-java">addAll</code>, <code class="language-java">removeIf</code>, and <code class="language-java">forEach</code>, are <em>not</em> guaranteed to be performed atomically.</p>
<p></p></div>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="communication-between-threads">Communication between threads</h5>
<p>The following picture demonstrates how to organize communication between threads using a queue. One thread adds elements to the tail of the queue, while another thread takes elements from its head.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><picture><img alt="communication between threads" height="136" src="https://ucarecdn.com/afdf8010-3627-4423-99ed-6c321acee910/" width="601"/></picture></p>
<p>Here, <code class="language-java">Queue</code> has to be thread-safe. Otherwise, it will not work correctly.</p>
<p>Thread-safe communication is also possible when more than two threads interact through a queue.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><picture><img alt="Thread-safe communication" height="169" src="https://ucarecdn.com/f7c072f0-2263-4b21-80c0-701d83d0052b/" width="622"/></picture></p>
<p>The number of threads can be different than in this picture.</p>
<p>Suppose we want to exchange data between two threads using a concurrent queue. One thread will generate three numbers, while another thread will accept these numbers and print them. The <code class="language-java">poll</code> method can get the current first element of a concurrent queue. It returns this element or <code class="language-java">null</code> if the queue is empty.</p>
<p>Here is a snippet of code with <code class="language-java">sleep</code> invocations to make the output more predictable. The <code class="language-java">generator</code> and <code class="language-java">poller</code> threads interact using a concurrent queue, and no data is lost because the queue is fully thread-safe.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">import java.util.Queue;

        Thread generator = new Thread(() -&gt; {
            try {
                queue.add(10);
                TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(10);
                queue.add(20);
                TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(10);
                queue.add(30);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        });

        Thread poller = new Thread(() -&gt; {
            int countRead = 0;
            while (countRead != 3) {
                Integer next = queue.poll();
                if (next != null) {
                    countRead++;
                }
                System.out.println(next);
                try {
                    TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(10);
                } catch (Exception e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });

        generator.start();
        poller.start();
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example of the possible output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">null
10
20
null
30</code></pre>
<p>In practice, the output may be different, but all numbers should be printed.</p>
<h5 id="composite-operations">Composite operations</h5>
<p>Every standard method of a concurrent queue provides thread safety. However, if you want to compose several methods, there are no such guarantees.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to add two elements to a concurrent queue so that they follow each other:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static void addTwoElements(ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Integer&gt; queue, int e1, int e2) {
    queue.add(e1); // (1)
    queue.add(e2); // (2)
}</code></pre>
<p>This method will only add two elements in the specified order if we have one writing thread. If there are more writing threads, one thread may perform (1), and another may intervene and do the same. Afterward, the first thread may perform (2). Thus, the order can be broken in some cases. This problem occurs because the method is not <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4987" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, atomic refers to operations that are indivisible, consistent, and isolated from other operations. | The Atomic API is a crucial tool for Java developers in concurrent or multi-threaded programming. Atomic variables and classes provided by the API ensure that code is safe and correct in the face of concurrent modification, while also achieving better performance and scalability. For instance, assigning a 64-bit value is not atomic on some platforms, meaning that while a thread writes a value to a variable, another thread can access an intermediate result. To make these operations atomic, fields should be declared using the volatile keyword.">atomic</a></strong>.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, bulk methods such as <code class="language-java">addAll</code> are not atomic and don't help to avoid this problem:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">queue.addAll(List.of(e1, e2));</code></pre>
<p>The problem can only be solved by external synchronization, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public static synchronized void addTwoElements(ConcurrentLinkedQueue&lt;Integer&gt; queue, int e1, int e2) {
    queue.add(e1); // (1)
    queue.add(e2); // (2)
}</code></pre>
<p>In this case, you need to be sure that all operations which update the queue are synchronized, not only the method <code class="language-java">addTwoElements</code>.</p>
